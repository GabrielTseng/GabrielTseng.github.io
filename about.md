Hello! My name is Gabi. I enjoy applying machine learning to solve difficult and relevant problems.
I am interested in solving sustainability challenges, particularly to better understand, mitigate and adapt
to the effects of climate change.

I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Okra Solar](https://okrasolar.com/), exploring the applications of machine 
learning to smart solar microgrids. I am also working with [Tommy Lees](https://tommylees112.github.io/) to 
[predict drought](https://github.com/esowc/ml_drought)  in East Africa, as part of the 
European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting's 
[Summer of Weather Code](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/learning/workshops/ecmwf-summer-weather-code-2019) program.

As a result of my work (and my own projects, some of which can be found  [on my github](https://github.com/gabrieltseng)), 
I learn new things all the time and hope to share some of that here.

I also have a non technical blog, at [oolongaloha.com](http://oolongaloha.com)
