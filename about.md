Hello! My name is Gabi. I enjoy applying data science research to solve difficult and relevant problems. I am particularly interested machine
learning, specifically: making machine learning algorithms easier to understand and therefore easier to use, learning from sequential data 
(including natural language processing) and generalizing algorithms.

I currently work as a machine learning engineer at [Drop](http://b.ewd.io/uxuze). Until it was acquired by Drop, I worked at 
[Canopy Labs](https://canopylabs.com/), where I explored applications of machine learning to customer analytics. Before that, I was part of 
[Professor Natalya Gomez](http://www.natalyagomez.com/)'s research group, where I studied the influence of the Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheet
on the Antarctic Ice Sheet, specifically in the context of Antarctic Ice Discharge events. This work was presented at 
[Polar2018](https://www.polar2018.org/).


As a result of my work (and my own projects, some of which can be found 
[in this repository](https://github.com/gabrieltseng/datascience-projects)), I learn new things all the time and hope to share some of 
that here.
