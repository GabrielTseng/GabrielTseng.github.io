Hello! My name is Gabi. I enjoy applying machine learning to solve difficult and relevant problems.
I am interested in solving sustainability challenges, particularly to better understand, mitigate and adapt
to the effects of climate change.

I am currently working with [Tommy Lees](https://tommylees112.github.io/) to [predict drought](https://github.com/esowc/ml_drought) 
in East Africa, as part of the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting's 
[Summer of Weather Code](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/learning/workshops/ecmwf-summer-weather-code-2019) program.

Before this, I explored the applications of machine learning to customer analytics, as a machine learning engineer at
[Drop](https://www.earnwithdrop.com/) and as a data scientist at [Canopy Labs](https://canopylabs.com/).

Whilst studying Physics in McGill University, I worked in [Professor Natalya Gomez](http://www.natalyagomez.com/)'s 
research group, where I studied the influence of the Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheet on the Antarctic Ice Sheet, 
specifically in the context of Antarctic Ice Discharge events. This work was presented at [Polar2018](https://www.polar2018.org/).

As a result of my work (and my own projects, some of which can be found  [on my github](https://github.com/gabrieltseng)), 
I learn new things all the time and hope to share some of that here.

I also have a non technical blog, at [oolongaloha.com](http://oolongaloha.com)
