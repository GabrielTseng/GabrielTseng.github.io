Hello! My name is Gabi, and I work as a data scientist in Toronto for [Canopy Labs](https://canopylabs.com/).
As a result of my work there (and my own projects, some of which can be found 
[in this repository](https://github.com/GabrielTseng/LearningDataScience)), I learn new things all the time and hope to share 
some of that here.
