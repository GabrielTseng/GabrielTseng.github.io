Hello! My name is Gabi, and I work as a data scientist in Toronto for [Canopy Labs](https://canopylabs.com/).
As a result of my work there (and my own projects, some of which can be found 
[in this repository](https://github.com/GabrielTseng/LearningDataScience)), I learn new things all the time and hope to share 
some of that here.

Prior to Canopy Labs, I was part of [Professor Natalya Gomez](http://www.natalyagomez.com/)'s research group, where I
studied the influence of the Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheet on the Antarctic Ice Sheet, specifically in the context of
Antarctic Ice Discharge events. This work was presented at [Polar2018](https://www.polar2018.org/).
